### Hi there üëã
My name is Kosuke Aoki (Japanese: ÈùíÊú® ÂÆèÁ•ê, pronunciation: `/Ààko äske…™/`, KOH-skay) and I‚Äôm Japanese. I was born and raised in Japan.

### Personal History
I was born and raised in Shizuoka prefecture. It is famous for Mt. Fuji, which is the highest mountain in Japan, and is located two prefectures away from Tokyo. I moved to Shiga prefecture, which is next to Kyoto, to go to university when I was 18 years old. I have lived alone from then on. After graduating from university, I moved to Tokyo for work, and I have lived there for more than four years.
